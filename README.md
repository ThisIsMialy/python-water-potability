# python-water-potability
Python ML that calculates water potability

Dataset
The dataset is a compilation of water quality metrics for over 8500 different water bodies. No
values are missing and data is clean.
Columns:
1. pH value:
PH is an important parameter in evaluating the acid–base balance of water. It is also
the indicator of acidic or alkaline condition of water status. WHO has recommended
maximum permissible limit of pH from 6.5 to 8.5. The current investigation ranges
were 6.52–6.83 which are in the range of WHO standards.
2. Turbidity:
The turbidity of water depends on the quantity of solid matter present in the
suspended state. It is a measure of light emitting properties of water and the test is
used to indicate the quality of waste discharge with respect to colloidal matter.
3. Temperature:
For public water supply, it should be between 10 to 15.6 degree celcius. The
temperature greater than 25 degree is undesirable and above 30 degree is unfit for
public water supply.
4. Conductivity:
Pure water is not a good conductor of electric current rather a good insulator. Increase
in ions concentration enhances the electrical conductivity of water. Generally, the
amount of dissolved solids in water determines the electrical conductivity. Electrical
conductivity (EC) actually measures the ionic process of a solution that enables it to
transmit current. According to WHO standards, EC value should not exceed 400
μS/cm.
5. Label:
Indicates if water is safe for human consumption where 1 means Potable and 0 means
Not potable.
This gives an insight to the water supplies available in a region and estimate the amount of
water that are safe for human consumption. It is important to know the potability as it can
lead to diseases and other harmful effects on the human population if they are not constantly
monitored and measured
